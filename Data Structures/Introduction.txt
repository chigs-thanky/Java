Java Data Structures

Data structures are ways to store and organize data so you can use it efficiently.

An array is an example of a data structure, which allows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.

Java includes many other data structures as well, in the java.util package. Each is used to handle data in different ways.

Some of the most common are:
1. ArrayList
2. HashSet
3. HashMap

ArrayList Methods like: 

add(); - To add an element to the array list
get(); - To get a specified element from array list
set(); - To change/modify a particular element from array list
remove(); - To remove a specified element from array list
